# Medical-Test-Records



## Problem

- Health care institutions gather and store sensitive information from patients such as medical test records.
- Patients can not always access their medical records in a secure manner
- Information systems do not always ensure fine-grained and contextualized access to medical records for relevant staff.
- Lack of connection and access to medical records of different partner institutions, with different infrastructures.


## Solution

- Provide a secure system to allow safe and confidential access to patient's medical records
- Ensure authentication and access control to certain resources for authorized personnel
- Ensure secure interconnection (sending and receiving medical records) between partner health organizations
